## Features of the Prototype

- When user sits for too long, the chair will shake or spin to warn user that he need to take a break from working.
- If user sits still for a long time so that the sensor detect that something wrong happen, the chair will make an alarm to wake user up. If user doesn't make any reaction to the sound, the information will be send to someone for help.
- The website shows about the sitting health status; Healthy, Normal, Stress, Almost Unhealthy, Unhealthy.
- The bar shows the ratio of sitting and taking a break period.
